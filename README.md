# TYPESCRIPT_BASIC_PROJECTS
This repo is created for practicing typescript projects


The maps folder contains a simple implementation of creating markers on google maps using the google maops api. The implementation consists of a User and a Company class where the data for the user and Company is created using the Faker package from NPM library. Once we create instances of the User and a Company we pin the User and the Comapny over Google maps. This was done using the parcel. 

Method of execution . 
Clone the repo. 
cd into maps.
install all the dependenices using npm install
Then run npx parcel index.html
open the URL in a browser.
